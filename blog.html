                <p class="font">From 2019 to 2021 SVB’s deposits tripled from $61.76 Billion to $189.2 Billion.  As I am sure you are aware, when you deposit money into a bank, they in turn take your money and invest through lending that money out.  However, in SVB’s case, the influx of cash from 2019-2021 happened so quickly that they were unable to grow their loan book quickly to appropriately reflect their cash positions.

Personally, I’m not much of a cold weather fan, so these signs of changing seasons have put a little extra spruce in my step.  Over the weekend I was able to bust out the ol’ lawn mower and cut my grass for the first time this year.

                <p class="font">Like many of you, I have been a victim of procrastination…ok, obviously victim is not the right word.  There have been times where I have struggled to prioritize my time appropriately.  I have been guilty of putting important things off until the last minute….and if you are wondering, yes, the idea for this blog came about due to some Grade A procrastinating on my part.  Today I will try and share a few strategies to help you deal with the procrastination that may have seeped into your financial life.

                <p class="font">The second most important Q acronym (behind QED of course 😊) that all retirees should be familiar with is QCD.  QCD stands for Qualified Charitable Distribution.  It is a provision in the tax code that allows for distribution from your tax deferred retirement account to go directly to a qualified charity.  This may be the single biggest missed opportunity for tax savings as there are so many people that simply don’t know about it..

Watching Chiefs games on Sunday afternoons has been a family bonding activity from as far back as I can remember.  If you have been a Chiefs fan for long, or if you have followed the NFL closely over the years, then you know my Chiefs fandom has come with its share of heartache.  This makes their recent success all the sweeter.

As I have gone through the different provisions, the best analogy that I have been able to come up with is that Secure 2.0 is like an ex-girlfriend; there are redeeming qualities, but I really wish it had just never happened.

                <h3>Why Your Investments Should be Boring: Part 2</h3>
                <p class="font">Why can’t I just pick one of the 10% of funds that has outperformed its benchmark? The truth is you can…if you can identify it.  While we certainly have back-tested data, mutual funds have very weak, if any, levels of correlation from year to year.  In other words, how a fund performs in one year is in no way a predictor of how it will perform in future years.  This ultimately leads to the conclusion that trying to choose the fund that will outperform is a fool’s errand.

            <p class="font">From the outside, starting my own independent financial planning firm may look a little crazy...and maybe it is. Getting set up for your own Registered Investment Advisory (RIA) is not for the faint of heart. You submit yourself to background checks, pay consultants thousands of dollars to help you navigate the complex registration process, create multiple business structures, and in the process turn your normal day to day on its head.  And this is just to get to day one of the firm.  Click to continue reading.</p>
