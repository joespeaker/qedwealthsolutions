                <p class="font">Asset allocation and asset location are two very important aspects of your financial plan.  The goal of asset allocation is to divide your investments into different asset classes, creating a diversified portfolio that balances risk and return.  On the other hand, asset location refers to the specific accounts in which you hold your investments, such as taxable, Roth, or tax-deferred.

As I am sure you are aware, when you deposit money into a bank, they in turn take your money and invest through lending that money out.  However, in SVB’s case, the influx of cash from 2019-2021 happened so quickly that they were unable to grow their loan book quickly to appropriately reflect their cash positions.

There have been times where I have struggled to prioritize my time appropriately.

                <p class="font">The second most important Q acronym (behind QED of course 😊) that all retirees should be familiar with is QCD.  QCD stands for Qualified Charitable Distribution.  It is a provision in the tax code that allows for distribution from your tax deferred retirement account to go directly to a qualified charity.  This may be the single biggest missed opportunity for tax savings as there are so many people that simply don’t know about it..

If you have been a Chiefs fan for long, or if you have followed the NFL closely over the years, then you know my Chiefs fandom has come with its share of heartache.  This makes their recent success all the sweeter.

                <p class="font">Why can’t I just pick one of the 10% of funds that has outperformed its benchmark? The truth is you can…if you can identify it.  While we certainly have back-tested data, mutual funds have very weak, if any, levels of correlation from year to year.  In other words, how a fund performs in one year is in no way a predictor of how it will perform in future years.  This ultimately leads to the conclusion that trying to choose the fund that will outperform is a fool’s errand.
