            <p class="title-font">Dreaming: My Why I Started My Own Firm</p>
        </div>
        <div class="date">By Liz Meyer</div>
        <div class="body-text">
                <p>After reading Tyler’s <a href=blog1.13.23.html>Why I Started My Own Firm</a>, and subsequently spending countless hours working on the behind-the-scenes details of QED Wealth Solutions to get ready for its initial launch and so much more after, I realized that, somewhere, I too have reasons why I put my time in to start this firm (and it’s not just to avoid that pile of laundry). Though truly, Tyler’s experience and expertise is the driver behind QED, we are certainly both a part of this business. So, during a 3am baby nursing, it finally hit me why I started QED. In one word…dreaming.</p>
                <p>Dreaming is one of my favorite things to do. Not dreams during sleep (though I do love my sleep), but dreams while awake. I think it’s part of what makes us human, and ultimately is directed to bringing us to heaven, but maybe more on that at another time. The way I see it there are three types of dreams.<br>
                    “What if”: those that never come to fruition<br>
                    “When and How”: those that inevitably will in some form<br>
                    “Someday”: those that depend on hard work and God’s providence</p>
                <p>Allow me to elaborate.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">“What if” Dreams</p>
                <p>These dreams are fun, and sort of pie-in-the-sky. You don’t really think they will likely ever come true, though with the right timing some of them may move to the “someday” category. An example: for many years I have dreamed of opening my own bakery. Now, I am a slightly above average baker who hates cleaning and isn’t interested in the amount of hours or work it would take to run a bakery. But still, I dream about it for fun. Tyler and I enjoy dreaming what we would do if we won the lottery, which is completely unrealistic, because we never buy tickets, but it’s fun to pretend.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">“When and How” Dreams</p>
                <p>For me, these are most often dreams about the future of my family and children. I can’t slow time so this future will most certainly come. These dreams are somewhat fluid, like I wonder what interests and hobbies my baby will have when she grows up. I wonder what the next national park we visit will be. I’m certain we will visit more parks in the future, but when and where is not determined…so I wonder, I dream.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">“Someday” Dreams</p>
                <p>These dreams are my favorite place to dream. They may or may not ever come to fruition, but with hard work and the grace of God they most definitely can. Tyler and I dreamed of changing some things in our house for 7 years before anything finally happened. Sometimes reality matches the dream, sometimes it’s a little different, but the thrill of seeing it happen is amazing!</p>
                <p>The QED dream was born out of many “someday” dreams. As soon as I gave up my career to stay home with the children, Tyler’s career became a focus of our whole family. And so, together, we dreamed. We dreamed of ways to make his career fit our family even better. We dreamed of working together as a family to be a force for good in our community and in our world. We dreamed of so many ways that we could support our future clients and help them achieve their own dreams. And now, thanks to many gifts from God and plenty of hard work and long hours we have created this dream, our own firm.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">To Our Clients</p>
                <p>I want you to dream! I hope your dreams for retirement are as exciting to you as fresh baked cookies (from my non-existent future bakery) are to my children. And then, I hope you work hard to achieve those dreams. I know you will. Whether they are small or large, QED is here to be a part of helping you along the way. Thank you for entrusting your dreams to us!</p>
