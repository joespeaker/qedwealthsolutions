        </div>
        <div class="date">By Tyler Meyer</div>
        <div class="body-text">
                <p>From 2019 to 2021 SVB’s deposits tripled from $61.76 Billion to $189.2 Billion.  As I am sure you are aware, when you deposit money into a bank, they in turn take your money and invest through lending that money out.  However, in SVB’s case, the influx of cash from 2019-2021 happened so quickly that they were unable to grow their loan book quickly to appropriately reflect their cash positions.  Since they were unable to grow their loan book quickly enough, they looked for alternative ways in which to invest this huge influx of cash.  At that point they turned to Mortgage-Backed Securities.  This may trigger a flashback in your brain as these were one of the main contributors to the financial crisis in 2008.  </p>
                <p>Mortgage-Backed Securities are essentially bundles of home loans (and other real estate debt) packaged into bite size pieces purchased from the bank that issues the debt.  In essence, they purchased debt from other banks.  The lion’s share (97%) of this debt was purchased with a 10+ year duration with an average yield of 1.56%.   As of writing this, the two-year treasury bond rate is 4.593%, essentially three times the rate SVB was getting in their Mortgage-Backed Securities.  It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to realize that securities producing a yield of 1.56% are worth significantly less than less risky securities that are producing a yield of nearly 4.6%.  Investors had already seen this as a huge problem as SVB’s stock price decreased to nearly $280/share nearly a week ago, off from a high of over $750/share a little more than a year ago.  Even with all this bad news, investors thought SVB would pull it out (albeit less profitably) as having these lower yielding securities was not a death sentence as long as they could retain enough liquidity to hang on to them until mature and then at that time re-invest at higher rates.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">Waving Red Flags</p>
                <p>As you have probably concluded, SVB did not hang on to these investments.  They sold over $20 Billion in these investments at a nearly $2 Billion loss.  In addition to signaling the need for liquidity with this sell-off, they also announced an initiative to raise an additional $2.25 Billion through equity and debt.  Obviously, this was a big signal to both investors and depositors that their liquidity was not in good shape, and this caused a good, old-fashioned run on the bank with many customers seeking to pull out their funds (think <span class="italics">It’s a Wonderful Life</span>).  Obviously, a bunch of people wanting to pull money out all at one time ($42 Billion in withdrawal requests on March 9th alone) causes big liquidity issues for the bank.  They simply do not have that much cash on hand, as much of it is deployed via loans and other long-term investments.</p>
                <p>With SVB unable to fulfill the withdrawal requests, the FDIC stepped in and took over management of the bank.  The FDIC ensures every American who has funds deposited at a bank up to $250,000.  What really makes this situation interesting is that over 85% of SVB’s deposits were uninsured.  This is largely due to many of the bank’s customers being tech companies.  As of my writing this on the night of March 13th, 2023, Secretary Treasury Janet Yellen stated that the FDIC and the Federal Reserve are fully protecting all depositors.  They also claim that none of the losses associated with the resolution of SVB will be borne by the taxpayer…No idea how that works…Seems like a fundamental misunderstanding of where the government’s money comes from to me.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">So What About Other Banks?</p>
                <p>This really does beg the question of if other banks are in trouble…obviously a collapse of our banking system would be absolutely disastrous for the overall economy!</p>
                <p>It is worth noting some key differences SVB has compared to other banks.  Due to their massive growth, a much lower percentage of SVB’s assets were leant out.  Generally, as interest rates climb, banks are in a better spot financially due to higher interest rates on their loans.  SVB having a lower percent of loans turned out to be a distinct disadvantage.  Another key difference is SVB’s concentration in tech companies.  While this led to the glut of deposits in the covid-era tech expansion, it also led to a glut of withdrawals as tech has waned over the past year.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">Can it Happen to Other Banks?</p>
                <p>The obvious answer to the above question is yes…but there are several factors that make it extremely unlikely.  Most banks are much more diversified in their customer base.  Also, very few grew their deposits as quickly as SVB did over such a short period of time.</p>
                <p>Signature Bank was closed down by the FDIC just two days after SVB.  While different, many of their woes can be boiled down to a concentration risk for them as well.  Instead of tech companies they were cryptocurrency focused.</p>
                <p>Obviously, regulators have a responsibility to shore up trusts in the banking system to prevent any sort of domino effect where bank after bank starts to fail due to a large concentration of deposits being yanked all at once.  If this panic-driven behavior can be avoided, then I believe this incident will merely be small blip on the radar of 2023 at the end of the year.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">Does this Change how We Manage Money?</p>
                <p>As we always have, here at QED, we are focused on long-term investment planning.  Our research-based investment strategy focuses on minimizing investor costs and eliminating timing errors by staying invested for the long-term.

            <p class="title-font">How Much are You Paying for Financial Advice?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="date">By Tyler Meyer</div>
        <div class="body-text">
                <p>A Harris poll in 2017 found that 60% of respondents had no idea how much in fees and costs was associated with the financial advice they were getting. This is for good reason as the financial industry has intentionally made it difficult to understand how much you are paying. I have found in talking with my clients that most people are woefully uninformed when it comes to understanding the costs associated with investing. It is my hope that reading this will provide you with a framework for you to determine how much you are paying for financial advice. Below, I have shown snippets from real statements to provide you with very practical tools to evaluate the costs associated with your financial plan.</p>
                <p class="bold">*All snippets provided are taken from actual account statements, with the approval from the account owner. Any identifying information has been removed.</p>
                <p>Our first example is on the summary page of your statement. This is generally page 1 or 2 of your statement.</p>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img id="img1" class="mt-4 mb-4" src="imgs/3.20.23.1.png" alt="Summary Page">
                </div>
                <p>As you can see on the statement above, I have highlighted the debits section as well as the disclaimer on the bottom that lets you know, in fact, that these debits include your investment advisory fees.  In this case, because nothing was added or taken out of the accounts, the entirety of the debits are investment advisory fees.  The $305.34 is the monthly advisory fee for this particular statement.  As you can tell, the period for this statement is the month of January.  If we take the fees of $305.34 and divide that by the original beginning value of $287,597.35, we get 0.00106 as a decimal, or 0.106%.  This is the fee, as a percentage, that you are paying every month to the advisor. If we then multiply that number out by 12 months, we get .0127 as a decimal, or 1.27%.   The number does not come out as a nice round number because this company charges on a per day basis.  Since account values move daily, when you do the math, it is unlikely that you will come up with a nice round number.  In this case, we can reasonably assume that the fee being charged is 1.25%. That’s what you pay to the advisor/company for their services.</p>
                <p>Re-stated, take the fees charged for the period (one month in this case) and divide by the beginning account balance.  Multiply that by the number of periods in a year and then convert it to a percent.  It should almost always equal between 0.5% and 2%. </p>
                <p>Of course, the easier, less “mathy” way would be to find your original contract with your financial advisor, or simply just ask your financial advisor as all of this information is required to be disclosed.</p>
                <p>In my experience, this is the piece that the 60% of respondents know and understand.  They pay x% to their advisor on an annualized basis for managing their investments.  Unfortunately, the costs associated with investing don’t stop there.  Often times there are significant costs associated with the mutual funds that are not disclosed on the statement. These are expressed as the mutual fund’s expense ratio.  Fortunately there is a way to discover the costs of these without any math.  You can easily discover the expense ratio on your mutual funds by typing in the ticker symbol and “marketwatch” on google.  This security description is taken from the same statement as above, I have highlighted the ticker symbol, which is AGOZX.</p>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img id="img2" class="mt-4 mb-4" src="imgs/3.20.23.2.png" alt="Summary Page">
                </div>
                <p>Grab the ticker symbol off your statement, type that into your search bar followed by “marketwatch”.  Generally it will be the very first search result, look for marketwatch as the main website.</p>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img id="img3" class="mt-4 mb-4" src="imgs/3.20.23.3.png" alt="Google search">
                </div>
                <p>It will pull up a screen like the following which will include a chart with historical performance.  What you are looking for is the total expense ratio which I have highlighted towards the bottom right corner.</p>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img id="img4" class="mt-4 mb-4" src="imgs/3.20.23.4.png" alt="Marketwatch">
                </div>
                <p>In this case, the expense ratio is 0.84% for this particular mutual fund.  This is charged in addition to the 1.25% for the advisory fee, so this client is spending 2.09% for this particular investment.  Now each different holding has a different expense ratio, so we would need to evaluate all of the holdings in the portfolio to know the aggregate expense ratio.  Just to help connect the dots, this would mean that the client would spend $2,090 in a $100,000 investment into the above mutual fund with the above advisor.  In my experience, very few people understand the expense ratio in their investments, and therefore do not understand the fees and costs associated with their investments.</p>
                <p>While some advisors believe these more expensive mutual funds are worth the cost, the research just doesn’t bear that out.  Check out my blog on <a href="blog3.13.23.html">Why your Investments Should be Boring</a> if you are interested in learning more about that.</p>
                <p>A quick note: This finds your cost of investing if you are being charged a fee for Assets Under Management (AUM).  While this is the most common way to be charged for investment advice, there are other ways you may be charged.  We will cover the different ways in later blog posts, like <a href=blog3.27.23.html>this one</a>.</p>
