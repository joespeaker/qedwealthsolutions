        <div class="date">By Tyler Meyer</div>
        <div class="body-text">
                <p>‚ÄúIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way ‚Äì in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.‚Äù ‚Äì Charles Dickens, <span="italics">A Tale of Two Cities</span></p>
                <p>The above paragraph has always been one of my favorites to read and reflect on in literature.  The vernacular is certainly slightly off from our contemporary vocabulary, which somehow seems to make it slightly more interesting, but it‚Äôs ability to seemingly fully summarize our current times while somehow inherently contradicting itself in each stanza is what really makes it stand out.  A Tale of Two Cities was first published in 1859 and when you read the first paragraph some 164 years later you can‚Äôt help but wonder if these times are now.  ‚ÄúSome of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only‚Äù ‚Äì Sure seems as if Dickens is explaining the modern-day political arena in America today.  </p>
                <p class="subtitle">Back to the blog on Financial Advice üòä</p>
                <p>If you have read the book, you know that the two cities that are being discussed are Paris, France and London England.  The book tries to encapsulate the stark contrast between the two cities and the societal and political upheavals of the times.  The goal of this blog is to not reach society wide and grapple with the issues of the day, instead the goal of this blog is to go to a very specific level, that of choosing the correct financial advisor, and detail the implications of this decision on your happiness and financial wellbeing.</p>
                <p>Jack and Jill, a fictional couple who are engaging with a financial planner after years of working in their water well business, engage with two different financial advisors.  The story that follows details their experiences.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">Path 1: The Investment Advisor</p>
                <p>In their pursuit of financial guidance, Jack and Jill first encountered Advisor #1, an Investment Advisor who specialized solely in managing investments. The couple shared their aspirations and concerns, seeking advice on how to grow their wealth and secure a comfortable retirement. The Investment Advisor diligently analyzed their financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Based on this assessment, they presented Jack and Jill with a portfolio of investment options tailored to their needs. While the Investment Advisor demonstrated expertise in the investment realm, Jack and Jill soon realized that their financial concerns extended beyond investments alone. They wondered about retirement planning, insurance coverage, tax strategies, and estate planning. However, the Investment Advisor's focus remained solely on their investment portfolio, leaving these important aspects unaddressed. Recognizing the limitations of this path, Jack and Jill decided to explore an alternative route.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">Path 2: The Comprehensive Advisor</p>
                <p>Determined to obtain a more comprehensive approach, Jack and Jill sought the expertise of Advisor #2‚Äîwho held several specialty designations, including Certified Financial Planner (CFP¬Æ). Unlike the Investment Advisor, the Comprehensive Advisor took a holistic approach to financial planning. They recognized that Jack and Jill's financial well-being encompassed more than just investments; it involved a much broader range of considerations.</p>
                <p>During their initial meeting, Advisor #2 spent time understanding Jack and Jill's goals, concerns, and aspirations. They conducted a thorough analysis of their financial situation and developed a comprehensive financial plan that considered investments, retirement planning, insurance coverage, tax strategies, and estate planning. This holistic plan provided Jack and Jill with a roadmap to address their unique circumstances and work toward their desired outcomes.</p>
                <p>Embracing this alternative path, Jack and Jill found themselves empowered and confident about their financial future. The comprehensive planning approach of the CFP¬Æ provided them with peace of mind, knowing that their entire financial picture was being taken into account. The Comprehensive Advisor regularly reviewed and adjusted their plan as needed, ensuring it remained aligned with their evolving goals and changing market conditions.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">The Importance of Comprehensive Financial Planning</p>
                <p>The Tale of Two Advisors intentionally emphasizes the significance of comprehensive financial planning. While investment management is undoubtedly important, it is merely one aspect of a broader financial journey. Our focus on continuing education here at QED Wealth Solutions allows us to serve our clients in multiple areas; integrating investments with retirement planning, risk management, tax strategies, estate planning, and more.</p>
                <p>By engaging in a comprehensive financial planning arrangement, couples like Jack and Jill can have peace of mind knowing that all the areas that touch their financial lives are being accounted for. They receive guidance on various financial decisions, ensuring that all aspects of their financial lives are considered. As stated in our core beliefs, this well executed plan leads to lower levels of stress and higher levels of happiness.</p>
