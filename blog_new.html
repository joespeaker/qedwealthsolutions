                        <p class="font">Rules of thumb can often provide guidance in the complex world of personal financial planning.  While almost all rules of thumb were originally based on a form of sound and practical financial advice, blindly following these common principles can lead to negative outcomes.  Whether it’s saving for retirement, budgeting for children, or managing your portfolio, these commonly accepted guidelines tend to oversimplify and if followed blindly could lead to negative outcomes.

                        <p class="font">Taxes are likely the single biggest expense you have in your lifetime.  While complete tax avoidance is nearly impossible for middle to high income earners during their earning years, with careful planning streams of tax-free income can be created in retirement.  By leveraging these options, you can significantly enhance your financial security all while lowering your tax bill at the same time.

                        <p class="font">When setting out to create your investment portfolio, maintaining a well-balanced portfolio is critical in helping to maintain your long-term financial goals.  I have given an introduction to the concept of asset allocation before, but stated simply, asset allocation is the process of dividing your investment portfolio among different asset classes in order to align it with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.  Through this process, a target allocation is created as a plan to help you best achieve your goals.  Rebalancing your portfolio is the process utilized to adjust your portfolio over time as it drifts away from your target allocation.

Obviously, our kids are still young, so the jury is still out on whether we have raised financially responsible children, however we have had some recent wins in the teaching money values department.  This is my attempt to share these wins and help to impart “wisdom” and inspire others on their journey of teaching good money handling and values on to the next generation.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and State Guaranty Associations each play a critical role in protecting consumers’ assets in the event of a financial institution’s failure or insolvency.

This is generally a mischaracterization, as these millionaires and billionaires are subjected to the same tax code as the rest of us.  They simply take advantage of the tax code either by knowing and understanding tax code, or hiring advisors who do.  Today’s blog deals with one of those tax advantages that you may not have known about.

                        <p class="font">Asset allocation and asset location are two very important aspects of your financial plan.  The goal of asset allocation is to divide your investments into different asset classes, creating a diversified portfolio that balances risk and return.  On the other hand, asset location refers to the specific accounts in which you hold your investments, such as taxable, Roth, or tax-deferred.

                        <p class="font">Like many of you, I have been a victim of procrastination…ok, obviously victim is not the right word.  There have been times where I have struggled to prioritize my time appropriately.  I have been guilty of putting important things off until the last minute….and if you are wondering, yes, the idea for this blog came about due to some Grade A procrastinating on my part.  Today I will try and share a few strategies to help you deal with the procrastination that may have seeped into your financial life.

                    <span class="paragraph">
                        <p class="font">The second most important Q acronym (behind QED of course 😊) that all retirees should be familiar with is QCD.  QCD stands for Qualified Charitable Distribution.  It is a provision in the tax code that allows for distribution from your tax deferred retirement account to go directly to a qualified charity.  This may be the single biggest missed opportunity for tax savings as there are so many people that simply don’t know about it..

                        <p class="font">If you know me well, you probably know that I am a big Chiefs fan.  Watching Chiefs games on Sunday afternoons has been a family bonding activity from as far back as I can remember.  If you have been a Chiefs fan for long, or if you have followed the NFL closely over the years, then you know my Chiefs fandom has come with its share of heartache.  This makes their recent success all the sweeter.

                        <p class="font">Secure 2.0 was passed as part of the Omnibus bill at the end of 2022.  As I have gone through the different provisions, the best analogy that I have been able to come up with is that Secure 2.0 is like an ex-girlfriend; there are redeeming qualities, but I really wish it had just never happened.

                        <p class="font">Why can’t I just pick one of the 10% of funds that has outperformed its benchmark? The truth is you can…if you can identify it.  While we certainly have back-tested data, mutual funds have very weak, if any, levels of correlation from year to year.  In other words, how a fund performs in one year is in no way a predictor of how it will perform in future years.  This ultimately leads to the conclusion that trying to choose the fund that will outperform is a fool’s errand.

Getting set up for your own Registered Investment Advisory (RIA) is not for the faint of heart. You submit yourself to background checks, pay consultants thousands of dollars to help you navigate the complex registration process, create multiple business structures, and in the process turn your normal day to day on its head.  And this is just to get to day one of the firm.  Click to continue reading.</p>
